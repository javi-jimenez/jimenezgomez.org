Recently I tried to generate a unique web page for showing my blog posts, without SSG (Static Site Generators).

<img src="./2025-12-02_08-55-blog-in-a-file.png" alt="SPA - Blog viewed with one only page">

The result, after many iterations, is an unique file `index.html` that reads posts from one directory, convert it to HTML and use the images in that directory with relative links.

I can change the style telling it to the AI. You can do some new versions depending on the next holidays, for summer, beach, Christmas and all that.

It is a first approach for what can be done, without having to fight with compiling and libraries.

It is really easy and AI is improving a lot from second to second, it is amazing and an inmense advantage for whatever human field.

I will continue researching about practical applications of the AI.
