> History is written,
in blank pages.

> Read books that create moments of inspiration, not the opposite.

> Everybody wants to be somebody.

> There are several realities: The group reality is a reality. That of the world is another reality. Your own is another reality.

> Expand your sight, go outside, across the door, to the reality of life.

> First make it work, then make it right, then make it fast. — @KentBeck
