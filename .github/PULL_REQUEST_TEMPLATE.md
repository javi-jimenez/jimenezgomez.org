## Pull Request: RFC edit or proposal

If this PR proposes changes to an RFC file (e.g. `tools/rfcs/RFC-0001-ASSISTANT_CONTEXT.md`), please include:

- **Summary**: one-paragraph summary of the change
- **Motivation**: why this change improves the RFC
- **Reference**: path to the RFC file and (if applicable) related issues
- **Test**: steps to verify behavior (if relevant)

Suggested process:
1. Create a branch named `rfc-0001-<short-desc>`.
2. Commit only the RFC edits in that branch.
3. Open a Pull Request and set the PR title prefixed with `RFC-0001:`.
4. Reference the RFC issue (if existent) and request review from stakeholders.

Maintainers will review the PR; if accepted the RFC will be updated and the PR merged.
